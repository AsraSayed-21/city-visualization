# city-visualization
City Data Visualizer is a simple yet powerful Python script that helps you explore and visualize city data from a .tsv file. It reads a list of cities along with their latitude and longitude coordinates, then does two main things:

Shows how often each city appears in the data using a bar chart.

Plots the cities on a map-like graph based on their coordinates so you can get a quick spatial overview.

This project is great for beginners learning data visualization or anyone working with city/location data. It also includes basic data cleaning — it removes extra quotes and spaces from the input, so things just work as expected.

All you need is a tab-separated file with city names and coordinates, and this tool will do the rest — read the data, clean it up, and generate clean, easy-to-understand visuals.

Whether you're working on a small data analysis project, practicing with Python, or just curious about how cities are distributed, this project is a great starting point.
